# Coen178-Database
Author: Kevin Vuong

This Database was created using criteria given for the COEN178 course at Santa Clara University. Project description is included as the file ProjectCOEN178_Fall2016.docx. This project was done with my partner, Gabriel Christ. The repository contains most of the sql code and php that we used to create the website for our demo of the project. The Sql code was primarily written by me while the GUI was done by Gabe. The combination of the two results in the website in the repository.
